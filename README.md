# basicfacedetectionopencv
This is a project which is an introduction to basic openCV. I used this as a first project to get into computer vision and it's applications.
You need to download the trained classifier XML file (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml and haarcascade_eye.xml), which is available in OpenCvâ€™s GitHub repository. Save it to your working location.
# Basic Face Detection with OpenCV

## Introduction
This project is an introduction to computer vision using the OpenCV library. The main focus is on detecting faces in images. This is a beginner-friendly project aimed at understanding the fundamentals of image processing and face detection techniques.

## Features
- Face detection in static images
- Utilization of OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascades for face detection
- Simple and easy-to-understand code for beginners

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library

2. Install OpenCV: pip install opencv-python

## How It Works
The script uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in images. It loads a pre-trained model and applies it to input images to identify facial features.
